This is my 4th project as intern at Elevate Labs, here i have to work on a verison controlled devops project.

Following are the steps that i took to make the project a successful one:
- Initialised a git repository and added readme and .gitignore file in it
- Created various branches according to the requirement and named them dev,feature and the origin branch main.
- intialised a commit message and successfully added a tag naming it v1.0
- added all the screenshots of the project that will display the ongoing process and relate the workflow.
- then i merged everthing to keep the repository up to date.
- now updating the readme file with all the steps used during the process.
- 

These are the commands that i used in the above project:

-mkdir ver

-cd ver 

-git clone "url  of the repository"

-git branch dev 

-git  checkout dev

-git branch feature 

-git checkout feature 
  (#The git branch command is used to create a branch and the git checkout command is used to switch to that particular branch.)
-git push --all origin
